# 🐧 Penguins of Madagascar - Species Classification

This repository classifies penguin species based on bill length, bill depth and flipper length, and . It includes an automated pipeline that fetches new penguin data daily from an API and predicts its species.

N.B: This project was based on a temporary API for fetching daily penguin data, After running this project successfully, the API has been closed, so the output will not be available in the github pages. 

## 🚀 Features
- **Database Creation**: Stores the penguin dataset in an SQLite database with two tables: `penguins` and `islands`, where `island_id` is a foreign key.
- **Data Extraction**: Retrieves and preprocesses data from the database for model training.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies the most relevant features using Mutual Information, RFE, Random Forest, and Permutation Importance.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizes features using MinMaxScaler and balances data using SMOTE.
- **Model Training**: Uses **Random Forest Classifier**, optimized with **GridSearchCV**.
- **Model & Scaler Saving**: Saves the trained model and scaler for consistent predictions.
- **Automated Data Retrieval**: Fetches new penguin data from an API every morning at 07:30 AM.
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automates prediction updates.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Displays the latest prediction --> [Penguin Prediction](https://pd-bds.github.io/MLOps/)

## 📊 **Database Creation & Data Extraction**
The dataset is stored in an SQLite database named `penguins.db`.
The `penguinsDB.py` script creates the database and inserts the dataset into two tables:

- **penguins:** Contains penguin features and species information.

- **island:** Stores island names with `island_id` as a primary key, which is referenced in `penguins`.

### **Extracting Data**
The data is extracted using SQL queries and converted into a Pandas DataFrame by joining island name using `island_id` for preprocessing and model training.


## 📊 **Feature Selection**

To identify the most relevant features, the following methods were used:

```

Feature              | Mutual Info   | RFE  | Random Forest  | Permutation  | Importance
---------------------|---------------|------|----------------|--------------|-------------
bill_length_mm       | ✅           | ✅   | ✅             | ✅           | Important ✅
bill_depth_mm        | ✅           | ✅   | ✅             | ❌           | Important ✅
flipper_length_mm    | ✅           | ✅   | ✅             | ✅           | Important ✅
body_mass_g          | ❌           | ❌   | ❌             | ❌           | Not Important ❌
sex_Female           | ❌           | ❌   | ❌             | ❌           | Not Important ❌
sex_Male             | ❌           | ❌   | ❌             | ❌           | Not Important ❌
island_Biscoe        | ❌           | ❌   | ❌             | ❌           | Not Important ❌
island_Dream         | ❌           | ✅   | ❌             | ✅           | Not Important ❌
island_Torgersen     | ❌           | ❌   | ❌             | ❌           | Not Important ❌
```

🚀 Final features used in the model:
- `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`

## 🏆 **Model Training**

The model was trained using **Random Forest Classifier**, optimized with **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.

### **Data Preprocessing**
- **Scaling**: Features are standardized using MinMaxScaler.
- **Balancing**: The dataset is balanced using **SMOTE** to handle class imbalances.

### **Best Hyperparameters Found with GridSearchCV**
```
Best Parameters: {'class_weight': 'balanced', 'max_depth': None, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 100, 'random_state': 42}
```

## 🔄 **Automated Prediction Pipeline**

The prediction pipeline is automated using **GitHub Actions**, which runs daily at **07:30 AM UTC**. It fetches new penguin data from an API, predicts its species using the trained model, updates an HTML file with the latest prediction, and deploys the result on **GitHub Pages**.

### **Workflow Setup (GitHub Actions)**
The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/daily_prediction.yml` and consists of the following steps:

1. **Trigger**: The workflow runs automatically at **07:30 AM UTC** every day using a cron job and can also be triggered manually.
2. **Checkout Repository**: The latest version of the repository is pulled.
3. **Set Up Python**: Installs Python and dependencies.
4. **Fetch New Data & Make Predictions**: Runs `prediction.py` to fetch new penguin data, preprocess it, and predict the species.
5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Updates `index.html` with the new prediction and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch.


### **Prediction Script (`prediction.py`)**
The script fetches the latest penguin data from the API, preprocesses it using the saved `scaler.pkl`, predicts the species using the `penguin_classifer.pkl`, and updates `index.html` with the results.


### **Deployment to GitHub Pages**
Once `index.html` is updated, GitHub Actions commits the changes to the `gh-pages` branch, making the latest prediction accessible at:
